# Components

The [Component list](1-Circuit/Components/Component%20list.md) is the Right Panel, there you can grab components and drop into the [Circuit canvas](1-Circuit/Circuit%20canvas.md).

Once in the circuit, each component has:
- [ Context menu](Component%20context%20menu%20) (right-click) with all the actions available for that component.
- [Properties dialog ](Properties%20dialog%20) (double-click) to configure all the settings available for that component.
