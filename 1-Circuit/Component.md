All components available are in the [[Component list]] in the [[Basic Use#Left Panel|Left Panel]], there you can grab components and drop into the [[Circuit canvas]].

Once in the circuit, each component can be cofigured by:

- [[Component context menu | Context menu]] (right-click) with all the actions available for that component.
- [[Properties dialog]] (double-click) to configure all the settings available for that component.

## [[Logic Components]]:
This is a group of components located in the [[Component list#Logic|Locic category]] that have some common properties.<br>

[[Logic Components|Check this page for more information about Logic Components.]]

## [[Reactive Components]]:
This is a group of components located in the [[Component list#Reactive|Reactive category]] that have some common properties.<br>

## [[Custom Components]]:

You can [[Custom Components|create your own components]] for SimulIDE.<br>
There are 2 main types of components you can create in SimulIDE:

### 1- [[Subcircuits]]:
These are just circuits hidden inside a package.<br>
Check the [[Subcircuits|page specific for Subcircuits here]].


### 2- [[Modular]]:
These are components created by combining different modules that already implemented in SimulIDE.<br>
Check the [[Modular|page specific for Modular Components here]].

Modular components include:

- [[MCUs]]
- [[MPUs]]
- [[Scripted]]

## [[Linking Components]]:

You can also [[Linking Components|link some components to other components]] to perform different actions.<br>

When you link two or more component, the "active" one will perform some action over the linked components, usually sending some data. <br>

For example you can link a dial to several potentiometers, then when you adjust the dial all the linked potentiometers will be automatically adjusted to the same position.

This feature is not available in version 1.0.0
