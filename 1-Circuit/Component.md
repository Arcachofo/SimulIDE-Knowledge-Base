# Components

The [[Component list]] is the Right Panel, there you can grab components and drop into the [[Circuit canvas]].

Once in the circuit, each component has:
- [[Component context menu | Context menu]] (right-click) with all the actions available for that component.
- [[Properties dialog ]] (double-click) to configure all the settings available for that component.
