You can monitor any UART of a Microcontroler or any other component with UART:

Right-Click on the Component and select "**Open Serial Monitor**".<br>
If there are more than one UART you will see a list of available Uarts.<br>
Choose one to open the Serial Monitor widget for that Uart.<br>
You can open several Monitors at the same time.<br>

The serial monitor is divided in two panels:

- **Right panel:** shows the **data sent**.
- **Left panel:** shows the **data received**.

You can choose to print the data sent/received in different formats.<br>
Click in  the button at the top right side and choose from the list:
