## Properties:
Property: (default value)

- **Common Cathode:** (yes) <br>
   Determines if common cathode or common anode.

### Red:
- **Forward Voltage:** (2.4 V) <br>
   Voltage drop for red channel when forward biased. <br>

- **Max Current:** (0.03 A) <br>
   Maximum current for red channel (it will blink if exceeded). <br>
   Maximum brightness is reached at this current. <br>

- **Resistance:** (0.6 Ω) <br>
   Series resistance for red channel. <br>

### Green:
- **Forward Voltage:** (3.5 V) <br>
   Voltage drop for green channel when forward biased. <br>

- **Max Current:** (0.03 A) <br>
   Maximum current for green channel (it will blink if exceeded). <br>
   Maximum brightness is reached at this current. <br>

- **Resistance:** (0.6 Ω) <br>
   Series resistance for green channel. <br>

### Blue:
- **Forward Voltage:** (3.5 V) <br>
   Voltage drop for blue channel when forward biased. <br>

- **Max Current:** (0.03 A) <br>
   Maximum current for blue channel (it will blink if exceeded). <br>
   Maximum brightness is reached at this current. <br>

- **Resistance:** (0.6 Ω) <br>
   Series resistance for blue channel. <br>
