This is a standalone dial ment to be linked to other [Dialed](1-Circuit/Components/Dialed.md) components like [Potentiometer](1-Circuit/Components/04-Passive/1-Resistors/Potentiometer.md), [Variable Resistor](1-Circuit/Components/04-Passive/1-Resistors/Variable%20Resistor.md) or [Resistive Sensors](1-Circuit/Components/04-Passive/2-Resistive%20Sensors/Resistive%20Sensors.md).

This is useful in several cases like dual potentiometers or using sliders in combination with screens, but also to create different components with scripts.
