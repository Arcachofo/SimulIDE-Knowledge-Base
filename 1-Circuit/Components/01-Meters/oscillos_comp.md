Oscilloscope with 4 channels identified with different colors and frequency indicators for each channel.<br>

There is one input pin per channel and one for reference voltage (last one besides Expand button). <br>
You can connect inputs to wires or enter a tunnel name in the corresponding box. <br>
Connecting the inputs and running the simulation you will see the wave forms.<br>
