## Properties:
Property: (default value)

- **Resistance:** (100 Î©) <br>

- **Size:** (8) <br>
   Number of resistors. <br>

- **Pullup:** (no) <br>
   Configure resistor Dip as pullups connecting directly to a voltage source. <br>
   If true, it will disconnect and hide pins at the top. <br>

- **Pullup Voltage:** (5 V) <br>
