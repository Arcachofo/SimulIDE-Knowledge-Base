## Properties:

All Logic Components in SimulIDE have a common set of properties:

### Inputs:
- **Low to High Threshold:** (2.5 V)
   Voltage to change from Low to High logic state.
<br>
- **High to Low Threshold:** (2.5 V)
   Voltage to change from High to Low logic state.
<br>
- **Input Impedance:** (1e+9 Ω)
   Impedance of digital input.

### Outputs:
- **Output High Voltage:** (5 V)
   Voltage of output High state.
<br>
- **Output Low Voltage:** (0 V)
   Voltage of output Low state.
<br>
- **Output Impedance:** (1e+9 Ω)
   Impedance of digital output.

### Edges:
- **Initial High State:** (no)
   Start simulation with High state output.
<br>
- **Propagation Delay:** ( 10 ns)
   Time from input change to output change.
<br>
- **Rise Time:** (3 ns)
   Time from 0 V to output high V.
<br>
- **Fall Time:** (4 ns)
   Time from output high V to 0 V.
