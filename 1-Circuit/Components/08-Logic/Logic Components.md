Logic Components work with digital signals: 1 or 0, and are usually made from assemblies of logic gates, often packaged in integrated circuits.<br>
Complex devices may have simple electronic representations of Boolean logic functions.

## Properties:

All Logic Components in SimulIDE have a common set of properties:

### Inputs:
- **Low to High Threshold:** (2.5 V)<br>
   Voltage to change from Low to High logic state.<br>

- **High to Low Threshold:** (2.5 V)<br>
   Voltage to change from High to Low logic state.<br>

- **Input Impedance:** (1e+9 Ω)<br>
   Impedance of digital input.<br>

### Outputs:
- **Output High Voltage:** (5 V)<br>
   Voltage of output High state.<br>

- **Output Low Voltage:** (0 V)<br>
   Voltage of output Low state.<br>

- **Output Impedance:** (1e+9 Ω)<br>
   Impedance of digital output.<br>

### Timing:
- **Propagation delay:** (1 Gate)<br>
   Total propagation delay of the device in number of gates.<br>
   Total delay = Gate delay x number of gates.<br>
   
- **Gate Delay:** ( 10 ns)<br>
   Time from input change to output change (1 gate).<br>

- **Rise Time:** (3 ns)<br>
   Time from 0 V to output high V.<br>

- **Fall Time:** (4 ns)<br>
   Time from output high V to 0 V.<br>
