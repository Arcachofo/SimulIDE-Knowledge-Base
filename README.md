# SimulIDE Knowledge Base

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault with Everything about SimulIDE.
Used to generate html for the web site: https://simulide.com/p/simulidekb/

Here I will add information about SimulIDE: tutorials, links to videos, development, etc.

You can get this Obsidian vault and add your own stuff, for personal use, classes, etc.  
Of course you can collaborate adding missing information, new sections, etc. and do a PR.  
In this case please keep the configuration as it is in the repo to have a consistent visualization in the web page.

**Work in progress**
