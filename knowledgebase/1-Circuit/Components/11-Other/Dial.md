This is a standalone dial ment to be linked to other [Dialed](../Dialed) components like [Potentiometer](../04-Passive/1-Resistors/Potentiometer), [Variable Resistor](../04-Passive/1-Resistors/Variable%20Resistor) or [Resistive Sensors](../04-Passive/2-Resistive%20Sensors/Resistive%20Sensors).

This is useful in several cases like dual potentiometers or using sliders in combination with screens, but also to create different components with scripts.
