SimulIDE relies in a set of external files for different purposes.<br>
In SimulIDE root folder you will see 2 folders:<br>
- **examples:** example circuits.<br>
- **data:** configuration and auxiliar files.<br>

SimulIDE executable must be in the same folder than **examples** and **data** to work properly.<br>

---

## Data folder:
This folder contains configuration and other auxiliary files for Microcontrollers, subcircuits, compilers, etc.<br>

Some dedicated folders are:<br>
- **codeeditor:** contains configuration files for the Editor and Compilers.<br>
    - **compilers:** here are configuration files for compilers.<br>
       You can edit some of these files if needed or add new ones.<br>
    - **syntax:** files to define highlighting for different languages.<br>

- **help:** files to add help text to Property dialogs.<br>

- **images:** contains images used by boards and some component icons.<br>

The rest of the folders are used by [[Custom Components]]: Subcircuits, Microcontrollers, Scripted.

---

## User data folder:
You can add or override any of the files in SimulIDE data folder using your own "user data folder".<br>
You can configure the path to your data folder in [[Settings#Application settings|Application settings]].

You can [[Custom Components|create your own components]] for SimulIDE and add to your user data folder.<br>
This way they will be there even if you change SimulIDE version.<br>
