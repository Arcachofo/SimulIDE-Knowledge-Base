### Left Panel:

In the left panel you will find 2 tabs:

- [[Component list]] to select components and add to the circuit.
- [[File explorer]] to browse your file system and open files in the circuit or editor.
  
### Central Panel:

This is where the action happens, here is the circuit, power on/off buttons, settings and information about the simulation.<br>

These are the main sections:<br>
- [[Circuit Tool bar]] at the top with actions and information about the simulation.<br>
- [[Circuit canvas]] in the middle,  here is where you create and simulate your circuits.<br>
- [[Info panel]] at the bottom left, with information about the simulation.<br>
- [[Message panel]]  at the bottom right, showing debug messages and errors.<br>
  
### Right Panel:

In the right panel is the [[Code Editor| Editor/Compiler/Debugger]].<br>
It also has its own [[Code Editor#Tool bar|Tool bar]] and [[Message panel]].

This is a text editor with basic coding and debugging functionalities where you can write or edit source code for the microcontrollers supported. <br>
You can also open any kind of files in this editor, including binary files.<br>
For example you can open and edit SimulIDE configuration files, circuit files, hex files, etc.

Then click in a Pin to start a wire and click in another pin to end the wire.

You can zoom in/out with the mouse wheel and pan with left button.<br>
Right-click in the canvas to open the [[Circuit canvas#Context menu|Circuit context menu]].

## Simulating circuits:

When you complete your circuit, click the Power button:  ![[poweroff.png | 20]]  in the [[Circuit Tool bar|Tool bar]] to start or stop the simulation.

You can pause the simulation with the pause button: ![[pausesim.png | 20]]
